Since the first news and gossip papers during the 17th century, technology made UK journalism an everchanging industry. Since the Great Wars journalism changed from a mainly written field to a multiplatformed discipline where radio, television, The Internet, computers and mobile devices made it possible to stay ever-informed.
According to research done by Ofcom, UK's communications regulator, television was still the most used platform for news consumption in the UK during 2020, with internet and social media closely following with respectively 65% and 45% of UK adults, 16+, using those to stay informed. 

Over the years physical newspaper consumption and revenue vastly decreased. According to Statista, expenditure on newspapers fell from 4.45 billion British pounds in 2005 to under 2.8 billion GBP in 2020.
According to Ofcom circulation of national newspaper titles has decreased from nearly 22 million in 2010 to 9.3 million in 2019.

This trend could be partially explained by the rise of social media concerns like Twitter, Facebook and Google increasingly claiming their share in news publication and spreading.
According to the Ofcom research, 45% of UK adults said to consume news via a social media channel of choice.

Although traditional papers are gradually shifting to digital platforms and apps to keep their public, social media still seems to be the biggest online newssource.

 Traditionally newssources in the UK had three main sources of revenue: subscriptions, public funding and advertisers.

A drawning man will clutch at a straw. As traditional newspapers are losing terrain, one could suspect new ways of finding public and thus revenue will be thought of in the highly digitised world. 
As social media made it increasingly effective to use shocking, polarising and click-bait titles and quotations to increase online interactions, a decrease in news neutrality could be expected.
