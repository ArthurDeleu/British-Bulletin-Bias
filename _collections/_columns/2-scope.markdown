In this project is was chosen to measure news neutrality in the UK specifically, to narrow down the field of research. The reason for the UK as a country was motivated by the fact that they have a, mainly, two-party system where parliament is dominant by the Labour and Conservative party, which would make research on political neutrality binary and sufficiantly easier.
One could raise the question why the United States where not chosen instead. The reason for this being that the US media landscape has been abundently written about already and research into European media is remarkably less frequent. 

An extra advantage of the UK as a country of research is the fact that the country has a state-owned newssource, the BBC. Findings on neutrality could be remarkably more interesting taking this into account, since one would suspect a state-owned company to be espacially truthful and impartial.
