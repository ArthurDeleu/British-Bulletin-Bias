A look into what papers people on each side of the political spectrum trust gives us an idea on potential political bias of certain papers.

Is there a reason for the fact that The Guardian is far more trusted by people on the political left? Is the decline in newspaper sales and the increasing suspicion explainable by the fact that UK media are not as trustworthy as they claim to be? 
If so, could one figure out if the papers actually publish politically left- or right-colored content?
