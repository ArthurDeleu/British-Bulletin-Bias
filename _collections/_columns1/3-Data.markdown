Although the UK media landscape contains multiple news sources, weâ€™re focusing on 21 newspapers.
 These newspapers are some of the biggest and most influential ones, but the main reason for choosing them was the number of quotes in the original dataset, Quotebank. For all the years, the following pie chart diagram shows the percentage of quotes from each newspaper. 
 
 *** "A dataset of quotes containing quotes from the BBC, Belfast Live, Birmingham Mail, Daily Mail, Daily Record, Daily Star, Digital Spy, Daily Express, The Herald, The Independent, I, Liverpool Echo, Manchester Evening News, Daily Mirror, Sky UK, London Evening Standard, The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, The Sun, The Times and Wales Online." ***
 
 Unsurprisingly, the number of quotes differ a lot between the newspapers. This could be due to differences in volume, but also the urge to insert quotes into newspaper articles.
