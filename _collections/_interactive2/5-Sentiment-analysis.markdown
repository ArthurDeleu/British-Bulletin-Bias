A common view on news nowadays is that its reporting always tends to be negatively biased.
By doing sentiment analysis on all available quotes over all papers the contrary could be concluded: newspapers appear to report more positive than negative quotes. Although most quotes are noted to be neutral, the positive class is on general larger than the negative one.

***"In general newspapers report more in a positive manner, than in a negative one."***

 This could contradict the popular idea that news is reported with a negative bias, always containing negative information.
